# VisionAssignment
 CIFAR-10- It consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes. Please find your dataset from the link : https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10
 
- Ploted samples from each class of the dataset 
- Applied rotation and height shift augmentation (rotation_range, height_shift_range) to the dataset separately. Print the augmented image and the original image for each
class and each augmentation. 

- Build models using L2 REGULARIZATION, activation functions

- Did Hyperparameter Tuning using two more additional models by changing the following hyperparameters ONE at a time. 
             1. Dropout: Change the position and value of dropout layer
             2. Regularization: Train a model without regularization

- Wrote the code for Model Building, Model Compilation, Model Training and Model Evaluation
